Goal: allow us...
    1. to check to see if all HTML files link to same CSS
    2. get styles in order of appearance
    3. check for DRY (across all css files - not style tags)
    4. check across all CSS for meeting requirements
    5. determining whether all HTML files meet all CSS requirements

Actions:
    * Keep order_of_css_by_file - use it to determine...
        if all files link to same CSS
        order of appearance

Guidelines:
    * Don't reinvent the wheel
    * Don't repeat myself
        - don't make more stylesheet objects than I have to

Questions:
    * Do I care about the cascade?
        - I might
        - If so, I should get a master stylesheet that is in the order of appearance
    * What's already in place?

SET CSS_file_data to empty list

        IF tag is a link to local sheet
